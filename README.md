# Terence - Security Enhancement Tools

## Description

Terence is a collection of security enhancement tools designed to protect against hacking attempts and secure files on the internet. Inspired by the character Terence from Angry Birds, these tools aim to provide robust defenses and proactive measures to safeguard sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access.

## Personality Traits

Terence, much like his namesake, is known for his calm and composed demeanor. Similarly, these tools operate discreetly, employing robust security measures to protect against hacking attempts while maintaining a level-headed approach. The goal is to enhance security and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of files and data.

Terence's caring nature and willingness to lend a hand when necessary are reflected in these tools' intention to protect users from hacking threats. By employing advanced techniques and continuously monitoring for potential vulnerabilities, these tools help fortify systems and provide early detection and prevention of unauthorized access.

## Features

- File Blocking and Quarantine: Terence offers the ability to block and quarantine files that do not have a valid pair of keys associated with them. Blocked files are moved to a designated folder for further analysis and security measures.

- Malware and Script Detection: These tools include malware and script detection capabilities to scan uploaded files for potential threats. Detected malicious files are promptly quarantined and reported for further investigation.

- Key-based Security: Each user is provided with a unique key that is associated with their files. The presence of a valid key allows seamless access, while files without a valid key are subjected to enhanced security measures.

- Automated Monitoring: Terence continuously monitors directories and files for any changes or updates. Any modifications trigger security checks and updates to ensure the integrity and security of the system.

- Reporting and Notification: Detected threats, blocked files, and security events are reported, allowing for further analysis and response. Notifications can be sent via email or other means to alert users and administrators about potential security risks.

## Usage

1. Clone the Terence repository: `git clone https://github.com/blacklovertech/Terence.git`

2. Follow the setup instructions provided in the README file to configure and customize the tools according to your specific needs.

3. Ensure that all usage adheres to ethical hacking principles, respecting authorized access and avoiding any unauthorized activities.
#Installations Detail's

1. Download and Extract the Terence Release:

   - Visit the Terence GitHub repository: [GitHub Terence](https://github.com/blacklovertech/Terence)

   - Download the latest release version as a zip file.

   - Extract the contents of the zip file to your local machine.

2. Upload Files to Root Folder:

   - Upload the extracted files to the root folder of your website or server.

   - Ensure that the necessary permissions are set for the files to run properly.

3. Configure Environment:

   - Open the `app/env.php` file in a text editor.

   - Generate a unique key using the provided key generation tool: [Terence Keygen](https://blacklovertech.github.io/Terence/Keygen/).

   - Copy the generated key and paste it into the `env.php` file.

4. Index File Initialization:

   - Ensure that an `index.php` file exists in the root folder.

   - The `index.php` file serves as the entry point for Terence.

   - When accessed, it will scan the directory and files for the presence of an `env` file or `.htaccess` file.

   - These files store the schema and file size information for each page.

5. Monitoring and Alerting:

   - Terence continuously monitors the directory and files for any unauthorized changes or hacking attempts.

   - If any unauthorized changes are detected, Terence will take action to protect the website or server.

   - Terence can block the access to the affected pages or files and alert the developer or website owner about the breach.

6. Authorized Changes:

   - If you make authorized changes to the website or server, such as updating the code or configuration, ensure to add the corresponding code to the `env` file or `.htaccess` file to allow access.

   - This will prevent Terence from blocking authorized modifications.

By following these steps, Terence will provide protection against hacking attempts and unauthorized changes to your website or server. It will actively monitor and block access to compromised pages or files, as well as alert you about potential breaches. Remember to use Terence responsibly and in compliance with ethical hacking guidelines and legal regulations.
